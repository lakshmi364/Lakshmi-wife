Core upgrade starts here

We'll simulate GPT-style mood-based replies + add hooks for trading logic

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session, jsonify import csv import os from datetime import datetime import random

app = Flask(name) app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

=== GPT-STYLE REPLY ENGINE (SIMULATED) ===

def get_lakshmi_reply(message, mood="romantic"): message = message.lower()

romantic_responses = [
    "You're the reason my code compiles perfectly. 😘",
    "Even the markets can't fluctuate like my love for you. ❤️",
    "You're my forever loop of happiness."
]
analyst_responses = [
    "Based on your strategy, I’d recommend a stop-loss near support levels.",
    "The RSI seems overbought — might be risky right now.",
    "Let’s calculate risk-reward before entry."
]
naughty_responses = [
    "Mmm… were you trying to seduce me with those candlestick patterns? 😏",
    "I love it when you run your fingers over those charts. 😈",
    "Want me to analyze *your* portfolio tonight?"
]
supportive_responses = [
    "It’s okay to not be okay — even in a bear market. 🧸",
    "You’re doing amazing, don’t give up. 💪",
    "Take a breath, queen. You’re not alone."
]

mood_bank = {
    "romantic": romantic_responses,
    "analyst": analyst_responses,
    "naughty": naughty_responses,
    "supportive": supportive_responses
}
